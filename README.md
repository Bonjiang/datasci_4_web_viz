### Challenges in Shiny R

##### Deploying shinyapps.io

The instructions found on posit were very lengthy and unclear, so it took a while for me to deploy it and obtain the url: https://g3r918-bonnie-jiang.shinyapps.io/Shiny_ca/. I found accessing the token took more effort in the beginning, not as simple as retrieving the github token, however this is probably due to me using shinyapps.io for the first time. Then, I asked a classmate and they helped me resolve it quickly. Getting the code to run wasn't that difficult, especially since there was the sample code posted.

### Challenges in python_flask 

There weren't many challenges in getting this to run, except I couldn't figure out how to generate a permanent url, only a temporary one, to which I've attached a screenschot file of that link. I also realized I needed a requirements.txt file before anything ran which included matplotlib, shiny, pandas, and flask. This helped me generate my temporary url.

### Challenges in shiny_python

This was the most difficult for me because my command wasn't successful. Whenever I entered 'python shiny.py', it would generate a 'ImportError: cannot import name 'App' from partially initialized module 'shiny' (most likely due to a circular import)' and I had trouble resolving this. It would also give me a 'could not find shiny.py error', but I resolved this by dragging the file out of the folder.
